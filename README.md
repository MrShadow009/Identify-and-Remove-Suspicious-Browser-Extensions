This task demonstrates how to analyze installed browser extensions, identify potential security risks, and remove unsafe or unnecessary ones. The project highlights the importance of **browser hygiene** as part of cybersecurity practices.  

---

## 🎯 Objective
To improve security awareness by learning how malicious or untrusted extensions can affect browser performance, privacy, and safety.

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. **Open Extension Manager**  
   - Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`  
   - Firefox → `about:addons`  

2. **Review Installed Extensions**  
   - Verified extension names, developers, permissions, and reviews.  

3. **Identify Risks**  
   - Flagged suspicious permissions (e.g., “Read and change data on all websites”).  
   - Found unused extensions slowing performance.  

4. **Remove Suspicious/Unnecessary Extensions**  
   - Disabled and permanently removed them.  

5. **Restart Browser**  
   - Verified performance improved and reduced background processes.  

6. **Research Risks**  
   - Malicious extensions can:  
     - Steal cookies or passwords  
     - Track browsing activity  
     - Inject ads or malware  

7. **Documentation**  
   - Screenshots were captured *before* and *after* extension removal.  

8. **Outcome**  
   ✔ Improved awareness of browser extension risks  
   ✔ Safer and faster browsing experience  
   ✔ Documented process for learning and teaching purposes
